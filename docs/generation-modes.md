# Generation Modes

SpecHarbor currently implements blank generation, built-in template generation, and guided generation.

## Implemented

### Blank Generation

```bash
go run ./cmd/specharbor generate add-example-feature --blank
```

Blank generation creates the OpenSpec change file structure so the user can write the content manually.

### Built-In Template Generation

```bash
go run ./cmd/specharbor generate <change-id> --template <template-name>
```

Implemented built-in templates are exactly:

- `feature`
- `bugfix`
- `docs`
- `refactor`

Built-in template generation writes deterministic, local, generic starter content for the selected template.

### Guided Generation

```bash
go run ./cmd/specharbor generate <change-id> --guided --type <type> --title "<title>" --summary "<summary>"
```

Implemented guided types are exactly:

- `feature`
- `bugfix`
- `docs`
- `refactor`

Guided generation writes deterministic, local starter content based on explicit CLI inputs. It is non-interactive and does not prompt during command execution.

Guided generated content includes the supplied title and summary. The generated content is safe to edit and does not mean SpecHarbor inferred project-specific requirements beyond the provided inputs.

All implemented generation modes create the required OpenSpec change files:

```text
openspec/changes/<change-id>/
  proposal.md
  design.md
  tasks.md
  acceptance-criteria.md
  risks.md
```

Existing files are skipped and are not overwritten. Partially existing change directories are recoverable because generation creates only missing required files.

## Planned

The following items are product direction, not implemented command behavior:

- AI-assisted generation;
- agent-assisted generation;
- hybrid generation;
- custom templates;
- remote templates;
- config-driven templates;
- interactive prompts.

Agent-assisted generation is intended to avoid requiring provider API keys, but detailed provider or agent setup is not part of the current implemented generation command set.
